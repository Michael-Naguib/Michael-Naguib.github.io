Michael Naguib is a college student pursuing a BS in Computer Science, with hopes of continuing on to a Masters & PhD.
I have experience in Multi-agent research and have a great curiosity for algorithmic processes.

Often I will code a project simply because it sounds interesting. The solution to a problem is not always nearly as
interesting to me as the process needed to compute the solution. Understanding the fundamental logic and intuitive
steps of a process for me is one of the more rewarding aspects of my field of study; understanding the rationality of
an individual's choices can inform me as to similar manners of thinking for when I attempt to solve a new problem.
I try to work smarter not harder, ironically however when you can't work smarter, the smartest move is to work harder,
as figuring it out will let you work smarter when you recognize the same issue in the future.

In my free time I will often take time to read, program, or hangout with friends. My hobbies include XC Running
🏃, Coding 👨‍💻, Drone Racing Quadcopters ✈️, & Boldering 🧗 . I am always up for a challenge whether it be abstract
or otherwise.
